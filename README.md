# KNN-k-nearest-neighbour-and-PCA
🔍 KNN + PCA: Classification with Dimensionality Reduction This project demonstrates the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification tasks, enhanced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
Here’s a clear and professional **GitHub description** you can use for a project involving **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** and **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**:

### 🧠 Algorithms Used

#### ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* A **supervised learning algorithm** that classifies new data points based on the majority class of their `k` nearest neighbors.
* Works well for **non-linear** data and is **easy to interpret**.
* Sensitive to the scale and dimensionality of data.

#### 📉 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* An **unsupervised technique** for reducing the number of features while retaining most of the dataset's variability.
* Helps in **visualization**, **noise reduction**, and **speeding up** training time for models like KNN.
